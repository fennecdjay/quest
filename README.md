# TODO
- Integrate mixins (ie `__mixins__`)
- Do we want mixins and `__parent__` to be separate?
- Cleaning up of hacky code
- Finish implementation of builtin objects
- Change `EqResult` to be only for `Key`s
- Implementing Copy-on-Write for object mappings?
- If the only arg to a function is an array, don't deconstruct it into values.
- Operator precedence
- Function calling allows for `.`, eg `12.'sqrt'()`
- Either solidify or remove the `$arg` syntax
- Blank expressions shouldn't be passing null as a parameter.
